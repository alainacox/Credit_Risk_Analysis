# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to use different techniques to train and evaluate models. I will do this by using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to resample the dataset. I will do this by:

•	Oversampling the data

•	Undersampling the data

•	Combing the over and under sampled data

•	Comparing the machine learning models 
### Six Machine Learning Models
•	Naive Random Oversampling

•	SMOTE Oversampling

•	Cluster Centroids

•	SMOTEENN

•	Balanced Random Forest Classifier

•	Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
## Results
### Naive Random Oversampling:
•	Balanced Accuracy Score of 66.73% 

### SMOTE Oversampling
•	Balanced Accuracy Score of 64.14% 

### Cluster Centroids Undersampling
•	Balanced Accuracy Score of 45.07% 

### SMOTEENN Combined Sampling
•	Balanced Accuracy Score of 58.33% 

### Balanced Random Forest Classifier
•	Balanced Accuracy Score of 89.96% 



### Easy Ensemble Classifier
•	Balanced Accuracy Score of 92.54% 


## Summary
Based on the balanced accuracy score all of the models were above 40%. Each of the models had misclassified high-risk clients. With the given dataset I would have to go with the model that had the ability to truly identify high-risk clients. If I am going based on the statement that I just made, I would have to recommend going with the Easy Ensemble model.
